# RayOpticsSpecialCase
A calculation of a ray refracted on sphere surface. The sphere and an incidence ray both have arbitrary coordinates.\
The project consists of two files:
1. Primitives. py describes objects like point, vector, and sphere, in 2D (except for sphere) and 3D
2. Description of methods to solve two problems:
    - if the stated ray intersect the stated sphere;
    - find the refracted ray if the incident ray falls on the sphere.

The second problem is solved in frame of vector algebra and using Snell's law.
