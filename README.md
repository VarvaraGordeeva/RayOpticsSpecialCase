# RayOpticsSpecialCase
A calculation of a ray refracted on sphere surface. The sphere and an incidence ray both have arbitrary coordinates
The project consists of two files: one describes objects like point, line, vector, and sphere, all in 3D area; the other file is a module for a prooblem statement (specific vector imaging the ray, data of the specific sphere) and solving two problems:
1) if the stated ray intersect the stated sphere;
2) find the refracted ray if the insident ray falls on the sphere.
